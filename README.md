This project demonstrates various techniques for face detection using OpenCV and Dlib libraries. The project covers face detection using Haar cascades, HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) models. Additionally, the project includes detection of other objects like eyes, cars, clocks, and full bodies using trained classifiers.
